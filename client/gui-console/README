I wrote the console client with only one purpose in mind: facilitating
automated regression testing with DejaGNU. If it's possible to play a game
using this client, that is a happy coincidence, but *not* a design goal.

The client code is, for the moment, just a copy of the client stub code,
with just a few basic commands implemented. The commands are:

* city
  Build a city.
* endturn
  End the current turn.
* focus SUBCOMMAND
  Manipulate the focus list. Subcommands: add TILE|UNITID, list, set TILE|UNITID
* goto TILE
  Send focused units to TILE.
* hover TILE
  Get tile info.
* lsc
  List all cities.
* lsu
  List all units.
* alliances
  Output dot(1) format graph of alliances.
* quit
  Quit client and kill subordinate server process if necessary.
* fullmap
  Show the entire map. Each character cell shows a tile, using the first
  letter of the terrain name.
* statc CITYID
  Show city info.
* statu UNITID
  Show unit info.
* n|s|w|e|nw|ne|sw|se
  Move focused units in direction given.
